      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 â€“ October 5, 2011) was an American
        business magnate, inventor, and investor. He was the co-founder,
        chairman, and CEO of Apple; the chairman and majority shareholder of
        Pixar; a member of The Walt Disney Company's board of directors
        following its acquisition of Pixar; and the founder, chairman, and CEO
        of NeXT. He was a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the
        1970s and 1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple
        co-founder Steve Wozniak.

        Jobs was born in San Francisco to a Syrian father and German-American
        mother. He was adopted shortly after his birth. Jobs attended Reed
        College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled
        through India seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism.
        He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I
        personal computer. Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later
        with production and sale of the Apple II, one of the first highly
        successful mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs saw the commercial
        potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a
        graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the
        unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh
        in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh
        introduced the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of
        the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector
        graphics.
